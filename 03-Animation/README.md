# Technical Achievements

I used the given data to make three different charts: a bar chart, a pie chart, and a bubble chart.


![barchart](images/bar.png)
The bar chart uses the count of each fruit as the height value and the color of the fruit color as the color of the bar.

![piechart](images/pie.png)
The pie chart uses the count of each fruit as the volume of each slice and also uses the fruit color as the color of the slice.

![bubblechart](images/bubble.png)
The bubble chart uses the count of each fruit as the size of the bubble itself and uses the fruit color as the color of the slice.

# Design Achievements

Transitioning from the bar graph to the bubble plot was much easier than dealing with the pie chart, but the piechart gave me a deeper knowledge
of how the animations and transitions work in D3.
