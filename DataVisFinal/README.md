Recently, Stop and Frisk has found its way back into public discussion due to the Presidential debates and it's a highly controversial and sensitive subject. It was referred to as something that was no longer in effect, which is not true. The subsequent discussion thereafter demonstrated how most people are unaware of whether or not stop and frisk is actually effective, what this practice yielded, and exactly how this activity ran and still continues to run on a micro-scale even now.

The goal of this project is to highlight who is being targeted and shed light into what is resulting from an ideology that may or may not be as effective as people would assume. The data for this visualization has been filtered to remove any logs that include an unknown race or sex. All labelings and identifications of race, sex, and other information comes directly from the source file itself.
